# Data-Cleaning-And-Analyzing-a-Fintech-s-Sales-Data-With-SQL-
In this project, we clean and analyze sales data belonging to a Fintech company stored in a MySQL database to aid in financial reconciliation.
The key items of interest were :
a) Identify  disparities in commision paid by the service provider. Checking if what was paid matched what was expected
b) Check for wallet deduction anomalies by the provider; checking if the amount deducted for a transaction matched the transaction cost.
c) Check for wallet funding anomalies by the finance team; to determine if the complete funds paid by the agents were used by the finance team to fund their wallets

The steps followed , and also the SQL commands used to create tables,functions and execute queris are contained in the "data_cleaning.sql" file.

The original table used for analysis is contained in the "main_transaction_log.sql" file.
