# Data-Cleaning-And-Analyzing-a-Fintech-s-Sales-Data-With-SQL-
In this project, we clean and analyze sales data belonging to a Fintech company stored in a MySQL database to aid in financial reconciliation.
The key items of interest were :
a) Identify  disparities in commision paid by the service provider. Checking if what was paid matched what was expected
b) Check for wallet deduction anomalies by the provider; checking if the amount deducted for a transaction matched the transaction cost.
c) Check for wallet funding anomalies by the finance team; to determine if the complete funds paid by the agents were used by the finance team to fund their wallets
d) Determine the validity of billed transactions; check if the references for transactions which were deducted from the organisation's wallet, originated from the organisation's servers .
